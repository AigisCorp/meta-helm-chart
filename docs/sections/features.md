1- Simplified Configuration:

- You can configure your application using a file called values.yaml.
- You don't need to deal with complex Helm templates to define how your application should run on Kubernetes.

2- Customizable:

- You can easily adjust various settings of your application in the values.yaml file.
- This includes things like changing the version of the application's container image, specifying how many resources (CPU, memory) the application should use, setting environment variables, and more.
- All of these customizations can be done directly in the values.yaml file, making it straightforward to tailor your application's behavior.

3- Compatibility:

- This configuration approach is compatible with Helm 3, which is the latest version of Helm.
- It can be used with any Kubernetes cluster, meaning you're not limited to a specific environment or provider.

4- Extensible:

- While you can use the simplified values.yaml approach, you're not limited to it.
- If you need more advanced configuration or want to use Helm's template capabilities for fine-grained control, you can include custom templates alongside the values.yaml file.
- This means you have the flexibility to combine the ease of values.yaml with the power of Helm templates when necessary.
