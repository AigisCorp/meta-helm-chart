# Usage

The primary usage of the Meta Helm Chart revolves around defining and managing your application's configuration through the values.yaml file. This configuration file acts as the central hub where you specify various settings and parameters that dictate how your application is deployed and run within a Kubernetes cluster. To facilitate this process, you can begin with a sample values.yaml file provided in the Meta Helm Chart repository. This sample file serves as a helpful starting point, giving you a basic structure that you can modify and tailor to meet the specific requirements of your application.

For those who are well-versed in Helm and wish to harness its templating capabilities for fine-grained control over Kubernetes resources, Meta Helm Charts offer the flexibility to include custom templates within the Helm chart structure. These templates, when combined with the values.yaml file, allow you to create a powerful, yet highly customizable deployment configuration. You can reference these custom templates directly in your values.yaml, granting you the ability to strike a balance between the simplicity of values.yaml and the robustness of Helm templates. This is especially beneficial when you need to implement intricate configurations, dependencies, or conditionals in your application deployment.

For a deeper dive into the usage of Meta Helm Charts, as well as comprehensive instructions, examples, and best practices, we recommend referring to the extensive documentation provided within the Meta Helm Chart repository. This documentation serves as a valuable resource that guides you through the various features and capabilities of Meta Helm Charts, ensuring that you can harness their full potential to manage your Kubernetes applications effectively. It's a wellspring of knowledge that can help you become proficient in crafting, customizing, and maintaining Helm charts, ultimately making your Kubernetes deployments more streamlined and efficient.
