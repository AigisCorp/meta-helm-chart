# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful:** We are all here to learn, share, and collaborate. Treat others with respect, kindness, and empathy.
- **Being inclusive:** Welcome and support all people, regardless of their background or identity. Be mindful of your language and actions to ensure that everyone feels included.
- **Being collaborative:** Work together effectively and strive for consensus. Disagreements are a part of life, but avoid aggressive or passive-aggressive behavior.
- **Being patient:** Not everyone will understand things as quickly as you do. Be patient and help others grow.

- **Harassment:** Any form of written, verbal, or physical abuse, discrimination, or harassment based on any of the above characteristics. This includes but is not limited to derogatory comments, slurs, and unwelcome advances.
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks:** Keep discussions focused on the topic at hand and avoid personal attacks.
- **Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.**
- **Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.**
